			<br>
			<p>Welcome. My name is Juan Carlos Urcia Barea.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I am a capable and motivated public servant based in Washington, DC.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I currently serve as a Legislative Correspondent for US Senator Ben Cardin. My job is to help advance the Senator's legislative priorities and oversee policy on labor, technology, immigration, and the social safety net. This has seen me develop and organize numerous bills and oversight letters, in addition to recommendations for cosponsorship, votes, and background memos for high level meetings and committee hearings.  
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>History, politics, philosophy, and economics are my passions. I am drawn to the intersection of labor and economic policy. How can they empower disadvantaged communities? And how can they create a more equitable economic distribution? These two fields are often kept apart. I want to unite them.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I completed my BA in History at Brown University in 2017, with a concentration on Ancient Rome and Late Antiquity.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>My long-term objective is to build an impactful career in public service while also learning more about the country and the world one step at a time. It has been a very fulfilling experience so far.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I made this website from scratch using HTML in February and March 2020.</p>
