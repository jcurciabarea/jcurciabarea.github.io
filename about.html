			<br>
			<p>Welcome. My name is Juan Carlos Urcia Barea.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I am an analyst and passionate student of political economy.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I work in the Sovereign Risk Group at Moody's Investors Service, and am responsible for the ratings and research and analysis of sovereigns primarily in Latin America such as Argentina, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama, plus Kenya, The Bahamas, and Cayman Islands. I have experience writing research pieces, designing elegant data visualizations, and explaining what's going on in different parts of the world.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>In 2022 I graduated with a Master in Public Affairs from Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs. There I pursued rigorous and technical coursework with practitioners such as Ashoka Mody from the IMF and Alan Blinder from the Federal Reserve. I completed a summer internship at the US Department of the Treasury's Office of International Financial Markets, where I designed and built a heatmap dashboard tracking macroeconomic and financial risk indicators for various countries.
			</p>
			<br>	
			<p>Prior to this I served as a junior policy advisor for US Senator Ben Cardin. This meant advancing the Senator's legislative priorities, overseeing labor, technology, immigration, and social welfare policy, among others. Notable experiences include helping to alleviate the worst consequences of the 35-day federal government shutdown in 2018-2019, and handling the policy responses at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly CARES Act and subsequent legislation as it pertains to unemployment benefits and state fiscal relief.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I completed my Bachelor of Arts in History at Brown University. The inspiration for my path was a class on political economy taught by the brilliant Mark Blyth, William R. Rhodes '57 Professor of International Economics.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I quite enjoy soccer, tennis, hosting people for wine, and reading about history, politics, and economics.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>The best thing I ever did was walk the Camino de Santiago over 27 days.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I made this website with HTML/CSS in February-March 2020.</p>
