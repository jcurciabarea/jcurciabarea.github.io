			<br>
			<p>Welcome. My name is Juan Carlos Urcia Barea.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I am an analyst and passionate student of political economy.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I work in the Sovereign Risk Group at Moody's Investors Service, where I am responsible for the ratings of sovereign governments primarily in Latin America including Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. I have experience with writing research pieces discussing economic and political developments, data visualization, and explaining what's going on in different parts of the world.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>In 2022 I graduated with a Master in Public Affairs from the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. There I pursued rigorous and technical coursework with practitioners with a focus on macroeconomics and finance. I completed a summer internship at the US Department of the Treasury's Office of International Financial Markets, where I helped track and analyze various risk indicators in different countries.
			</p>
			<br>	
			<p>Prior to this I served as a junior policy advisor for US Senator Ben Cardin. This meant advancing the Senator's legislative priorities across a policy portfolio of labor, technology, immigration, civil rights, and social welfare. In my time in the Senate I worked on addressing effects of the 35-day federal government shutdown in 2018-2019 on federal employees, as well as some of the policy responses at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the CARES Act and related legislation as it pertains to unemployment benefits and state fiscal relief.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I completed my Bachelor of Arts in History at Brown University. The inspiration for my path was a class on political economy taught by the brilliant Mark Blyth, William R. Rhodes '57 Professor of International Economics, as well as exposure to news surrounding the Global Financial Crisis, and the Eurozone Debt Crisis.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I enjoy soccer, tennis, and reading about history, politics, and economics. I was born in the United States and am half Spanish and half Peruvian.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>The best thing I ever did was walk the Camino de Santiago over 27 days.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I made this website with HTML/CSS in February-March 2020.</p>
