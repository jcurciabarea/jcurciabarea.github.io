			<p>My name is Juan Carlos Urcia Barea. I am a public servant with a strong passion for politics. I currently serve as a Legislative Correspondent for United States Senator Ben Cardin [D-MD] in Washington, D.C.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In this capacity I support the Floor Director and Chief Counsel in advising the Senator on issues in labor, welfare, technology, immigration, and civil rights policy. This includes advancing his legislative priorities through drafting and introducing bills, developing recommendations on bills and nominations, and interfacing with constituents and lobbyists.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I am particularly focused on labor and economic policy, which I believe can empower disadvantaged communities and create a more equitable distribution of outcomes. To that end I am interested in learning more about organized labor, collective bargaining, trade, finance, monetary policy, and fiscal policy.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I completed my B.A. in History at Brown University in 2017. My concentration centered on the study of Ancient Rome and Late Antiquity, and I took additional coursework in Political Science, Economics, and Computer Science. My interests spanned from courses on ancient Rome to the Bretton Woods international monetary system. Be it the job market or the legal and normative structures of our society, these aspects of our world are human by design. History shows us that these constructs are not immutable laws of nature. Through political action, we can change them.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I aspire to be a leader in public service in the federal government. Complementing my professional work, I endeavor to learn more about labor and economic policy by reading the works of noted authors and conducting my own research.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This website is a way for me to share a bit about myself. I made it in HTML and CSS from scratch in February 2020.</p>
