			<p>Welcome. My name is Juan Carlos Urcia Barea. I am a capable and motivated public servant currently based in Washington, DC. I made this website in HTML and CSS in order to share a bit about myself.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I currently serve as a Legislative Correspondent for United States Senator Ben Cardin. I help oversee to advance the Senator's legislative priorities and oversee an issue portfolio of labor, social safety net, technology, immigration, and civil rights policy.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Topics of particular interest are labor and economic policy, tools that can help empower disadvantaged communities and create a more equitable economic distribution. I hope to learn more about collective bargaining and workers' rights, in addition to financial markets, international trade, and monetary and fiscal policy.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I completed my Bachelor of Arts in History at Brown University in 2017, with a concentration on Ancient Rome and Late Antiquity.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>My long-term objective is to build an impactful career in federal service while also learning more about the country and the world one step at a time. It has been a very fun experience so far.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I made this website in HTML and CSS in the early months of 2020.</p>
