			<p>My name is Juan Carlos Urcia Barea. I made this website in HTML to share a bit about myself.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I am a capable and motivated public servant based in Washington, D.C.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I currently serve as a Legislative Correspondent for U.S. Senator Ben Cardin. I help advance the Senator's legislative priorities and oversee an issue portfolio of labor, social safety net, technology, immigration, and civil rights policy. I have helped to write and manage bills, oversight letters to the administration, and provide critical support and insights during extreme moments such as the 2018-2019 federal government shutdown and the 2020 impeachment trial.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>History, politics, philosophy, and economics are my passions. In terms of my current professional and academic interests, I am drawn to the interaction of labor and economic policy. How can they empower disadvantaged communities? And how can they create a more equitable economic distribution? These two fields are often kept apart. I want to unite them.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I completed my B.A. in History at Brown University in 2017, with a concentration on Ancient Rome and Late Antiquity.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>My long-term objective is to build an impactful career in federal service while also learning more about the country and the world one step at a time. It has been a very fun experience so far.</p>
