			<p>A capable and motivated public servant with a passion for politics.  I currently serve as a Legislative Correspondent for United States Senator Ben Cardin [D-MD] in Washington, DC.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In this capacity I work alongside the Floor Director and Chief Counsel in advising the Senator on labor, social safety net, technology, immigration, and civil rights policy.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I am particularly focused on labor and economic policy, tools which I believe can help empower disadvantaged communities and create a more equitable economic distribution.  Some literary topics of interest include philosophy and the interaction between politics, markets, and states.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I completed my BA in History at Brown University in 2017, with a concentration on Ancient Rome and Late Antiquity and additional coursework in Economics, Political Science, and Computer Science.  I am thoroughly interested in the roots and running of things, particulary those that make up the <i>social</i> or <i>human</i> world.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>My long-term objective is to build an impactful career in federal service while also learning more about the country and the world one step at a time. It has been a very fun experience so far.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I made this website in HTML and CSS in the early months of 2020.</p>
