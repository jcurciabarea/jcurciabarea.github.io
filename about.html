			<br>
			<p>Welcome. My name is Juan Carlos Urcia Barea.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I am pursuing a Master in Public Affairs at Princeton University.</p>
			<br>
			<p>My graduate studies have centered on macroeconomics, finance, and political economy. I have taken rigorous economic and technical coursework with notable practitioners such as Ashoka Mody of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Alan Blinder of the Federal Reserve. I completed a summer internship at the US Treasury Department's Office of International Financial Markets, where I built a heatmap dashboard tracking macroeconomic and financial risk indicators for various countries, using Excel and Haver Analytics.
			</p>
			<br>	
			<p>I most recently served as a Legislative Correspondent for US Senator Ben Cardin. My job was to help advance the Senator's legislative priorities and oversee policy on labor, technology, immigration, and the social safety net. I provided recommendations to the Senator on pending legislation and nominations, and prepared him for meetings and committee hearings. In my time there I worked directly on alleviating the effects of the 35-day federal government shutdown in the winter of 2018-2019 and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses for unemployment benefits and state fiscal relief.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Economics, politics, and history are my passions. I am interested in the evolving relationship between the state and the market, as well as the role of the state in an increasingly interconnected and globalized world. How to balance competing economic and political interests?
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I completed my Bachelor of Arts in History at Brown University, focusing on Ancient Rome and Late Antiquity. I engaged in significant coursework in economics and politics, including a course on international political economy taught by Mark Blyth.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>My long-term objective is to continue to learn and build a career in the field of macroeconomics and finance.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I made this website from scratch using HTML in February and March 2020.</p>
